Travis CI is a continuous integration service that is used mostly in Github. It also provides free plan for open source projects. Also it is a hosted service, which means you don't have to host your own server unlike jenkins.

*Note: This tutorial is mostly an explanation how to use Travis CI, if you want to learn what continuous integration and Continuous Delivery are, then check the tutorial before [What does Jenkins do?](https://petercoding.com/devops/2019/07/15/what-does-jenkins-do/)*

## Setup Travis CI

It is very simple to setup travis in your open source project. First you need to navigate to the following website [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org). Then sign in using your github account and give travis ci authorization. You will be presented with the following page:

<img data-sizes="auto" class="lazy-loading" data-src="/assets/images/rsz_travis.jpg" src="/assets/images/travishome.jpg" alt="travis ci home" data-srcset="/assets/images/travishome.jpg 300w,
    /assets/images/travishome.jpg 600w,
    /assets/images/travishome.jpg 900w">

In that page, you can find all your repositories at Github. You can then activate any repository to be used in travis ci. First click on a repository and then click on *activate button* so it can be used inside of travis ci.

<img data-sizes="auto" class="lazy-loading" data-src="/assets/images/activate.jpg" src="/assets/images/activate.jpg" alt="activate travis ci" data-srcset="/assets/images/activate.jpg 300w,
    /assets/images/activate.jpg 600w,
    /assets/images/activate.jpg 900w">

Then to activate travis ci on every commit in the repository, you need to create a configuration file and call it `.travis.yml`. Travis CI supports many programming languages, you can find the details of each langauge in the following link [Travis CI Docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/). Now, since this is an ionic project, I will use the language `nodejs` inside the `.travis.yml` file. For example inside the `.travis.yml` you can write the following:

```
language: node_js
node_js:
  - 7
```

This will specify that `nodejs` is the language and that version 7 needs to be used. After executing `git push origin master`, travis ci will build the project. So first the command `npm install` will be executed and then `npm test` will be executed. Since this is an ionic project then in the `package.json` there will be `ng test` for the script `test`. You can then access the logs of the builds by going to to travis ci. You will also recieve an email about the status of the build. Also when the build is triggered it will update all the dependencies that contain new versions.

<img data-sizes="auto" class="lazy-loading" data-src="/assets/images/buildfailed.jpg" src="/assets/images/buildfailed.jpg" alt="travis ci build failed" data-srcset="/assets/images/activate.jpg 300w,
    /assets/images/buildfailed.jpg 600w,
    /assets/images/buildfailed.jpg 900w">

As you can see in the repository the build failed, and you can know what the error is by checking the logs. -->
